You will usually be matched with someone who is within an order of magnitude of you on revenue and within a few hours time difference. Sometimes I might break the mold in order to match you with an interesting person who doesn't fit the normal criteria.

The goal is no bad matches.\",\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"How are matches scheduled?\",\n    answer: \"You'll be matched with someone in a similar timezone and from there it will be up to you and your match to find a time that works.\",\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"What happens if I don't show up for a match I've scheduled?\",\n    answer: \"You'll be kicked out of the club.

There is currently no revenue requirement to join the club, but you will be matched with founders at a similar level to you in terms of revenue most of the time.
